# Digit Practice

It's a project where you have to write the words that appear on your screen as fast as possible!

> You have 60 seconds to do so.

**That's the first page, when you open up the file**.

If you click `Start`, the words begin to appear on you screen, and you have to write'em down.  
As you complete, the word's gonna change.
